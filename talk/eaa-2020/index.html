Our project seeks to address both scientific and public policy goals to identify conditions that have influenced human decisions to migrate in response to changing climatic conditions and support local, Indigenous, and descendant communities in building effective strategies to adapt to current and future climate change. Framing our research using an archaeological implementation of the human security approach developed by the United Nations Development Programme, we will create a crowdsourced database of global scope to collect and synthesize archaeological examples of climate-related migration from 4000 BP to CE 1750. In this presentation, we outline the project and its key elements with a focus on how we will use the findings of this research to work with select Indigenous communities currently impacted by a rapidly warming world.">

      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p class="pub-abstract">The world’s Indigenous peoples are among those most dramatically affected by the increasingly rapid pace of global climate warming and many will become climate-related migrants, losing both their homelands and lifeways. Although contemporary social scientists have studied climate-related migration and its outcomes intensively, little consensus has been reached to define the most significant social and environmental factors that promote or constrain migration and that may have been responsible for creating conditions of vulnerability in the societies confronted by climate change. This situation has been worsened by a failure to consider the historical contexts of migrations and the ways in which past decisions have affected modern outcomes. Our project, one of the three proposals initiated by the 2019 CfAS workshop on migration, proposes that comparative, synthetic archaeological research offers a powerful way to explore systematically the interaction of social and ecological factors within contexts of climate related migration and thus contribute a historical and social perspective useful to the contemporary world. Our project seeks to address both scientific and public policy goals to identify conditions that have influenced human decisions to migrate in response to changing climatic conditions and support local, Indigenous, and descendant communities in building effective strategies to adapt to current and future climate change. Framing our research using an archaeological implementation of the human security approach developed by the United Nations Development Programme, we will create a crowdsourced database of global scope to collect and synthesize archaeological examples of climate-related migration from 4000 BP to CE 1750. In this presentation, we outline the project and its key elements with a focus on how we will use the findings of this research to work with select Indigenous communities currently impacted by a rapidly warming world.</p>
