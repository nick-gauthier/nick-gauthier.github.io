These bacteria ferment organic matter, producing the short-chain fatty acid butyrate. However, the macroecological influences on their biogeographical distribution remain poorly resolved. Here we aimed to characterise their global distribution together with key explanatory climatic, geographical and physicochemical variables. We developed new normalised butyrate production capacity (BPC) indices derived from global metagenomic (n = 13,078) and Australia-wide soil 16S rRNA (n = 1331) data, using Geographic Information System (GIS) and modelling techniques to detail their ecological and biogeographical associations. The highest median BPC scores were found in anoxic and fermentative environments, including the human (BPC = 2.99) and non-human animal gut (BPC = 2.91), and in some plant–soil systems (BPC = 2.33). Within plant–soil systems, roots (BPC = 2.50) and rhizospheres (BPC = 2.34) had the highest median BPC scores. Among soil samples, geographical and climatic variables had the strongest overall effects on BPC scores (variable importance score range = 0.30–0.03), with human population density also making a notable contribution (variable importance score = 0.20). Higher BPC scores were in soils from seasonally productive sandy rangelands, temperate rural residential areas and sites with moderate-to-high soil iron concentrations. Abundances of butyrate-producing bacteria in outdoor soils followed complex ecological patterns influenced by geography, climate, soil chemistry and hydrological fluctuations. These new macroecological insights further our understanding of the ecological patterns of outdoor butyrate-producing bacteria, with implications for emerging microbially focused ecological and human health policies.","tags":null,"title":"The macroecology of butyrate-producing bacteria via metagenomic assessment of butyrate production capacity","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Off the coast of Florida lie hidden traces of remarkable environmental engineering – artificial islands and coastal structures built by indigenous peoples centuries ago.

The long-term hydrological impacts of these and the demographic and socio-political drivers of construction and maintenance have yet to be fully documented or vetted. This paper summarizes existing knowledge attained from the United Stated portion of the NAS, but a lot is still unknown about Northwest Mexico. There remain outstanding questions related to understanding how ancient agriculture might improve modern adaptability and resilience. The detailed ecological and topographical variability of this arid landscape illustrates the essential need for infrastructure in maintaining water and managing the impacts of climate change on the hydrological cycle. We describe pros and cons of different types of infrastructure and examine socio-environmental trade-offs between robustness and vulnerability produced by reliance on infrastructure, drawing from existing literature to examine timescales longer than a human lifespan. The development of historically-informed management approaches to increase dryland climate resilience benefits from incorporating constraints and opportunities mediated by past landscape modifications. We present a plan for leveraging existing knowledge, available science, and potential, to extend our knowledge base and further explore causal relationships.","tags":null,"title":"Ancient infrastructure offers sustainable agricultural solutions to dryland farming","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Mediterranean Basin harbors an extraordinary diversity of plant life, including over 350 species of bellflowers - half of which are found nowhere else on Earth.

This review is the first to consider how scholars in all of these disciplines approach HCS studies. It begins by explaining how climatic changes and anomalies are reconstructed by paleoclimatologists and historical climatologists. It then provides a broad overview of major changes and anomalies over the 300,000-year history of Homo sapiens, explaining both the causes and environmental consequences of these fluctuations. Next, it introduces the sources, methods, and models employed by scholars in major HCS disciplines. It continues by describing the debates, themes, and findings of HCS scholarship in its major disciplines, and then outlines the potential of transdisciplinary, 'consilient' approaches to the field. It concludes by explaining how HCS studies can inform policy and activism that confronts anthropogenic global warming.","tags":null,"title":"“The history of climate and society: a review of the influence of climate change on the human past","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Nicolas Gauthier**","Bethany Coulthard","Kevin J.

Climate models are important tools for exploring historical and future snowpack dynamics, yet their relatively coarse spatial resolution can distort local topography and bias spatial patterns of accumulation and ablation. Here, we explore pattern-based statistical downscaling methods for application to simulations of spatially continuous interannual snowpack variability. Coupled pattern-based methods yield accurate, high resolution maps that correct mean and variance biases in domain-wide simulated snowpack. We find that a few leading patterns, present in both observations and reanalyses, capture the majority of snowpack variability across this domain. Methods that use large-scale patterns as both predictors and predictands perform better than those that do not, but we find that all are superior to a local interpolation-based approach. These findings suggest that pattern-based methods are appropriate for downscaling interannual snowpack variability, and that employing physically meaningful large-scale patterns is more important than the details of any particular downscaling method.","tags":null,"title":"Pattern-based downscaling of snowpack variability in the western United States","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Nicolas Gauthier**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640390400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640390400,"objectID":"ce3ad87e3c82254f622fee11fa3a3fdb","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/publication/risk-perception/","publishdate":"2021-12-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/risk-perception/","section":"publication","summary":"Small-scale agriculturalists in the Mediterranean Basin rely on multiple strategies including diversification, intensification, and storage to maintain a stable food supply in the face of environmental uncertainty. Each of these strategies requires farmers to make specific resource allocation decisions in response to environmental risks and is thus sensitive to variability in both the spatiotemporal pattern of risk and the ability of farmers to perceive that pattern. In this chapter, I present a simple agent-based model of a Mediterranean agroecosystem. By driving the model with realistic environmental dynamics derived from simulations of mid-Holocene Mediterranean climate, and by allowing the psychology of risk perception to vary among individual farmers, I explore the hidden vulnerabilities of traditional risk-management strategies to periods of rapid climate change. I show that even when farmers are able to manage risk 'optimally' in light of past experience, unanticipated changes in the spatiotemporal pattern of rainfall can still lead to major food shortfalls.","tags":null,"title":"The dynamics of risk perception in a Mediterranean agroecosystem","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

Settlements (cities, towns, villages) are locations with two key attributes: They frame human interactions and activities in space, and they are where people dwell or live. Sustainability, in this case, focuses on the capacity of structures and functions of a settlement system (geography, demography, institutions) to provide for continuity of safe habitation. The 7,000-y-old experience of urbanism, as revealed by archaeology and history, includes many instances of settlements and settlement systems enduring, adapting to, or generating environmental, institutional, and technological changes. The field of urban sustainability lacks a firm scientific foundation for understanding the long durée, relying instead on narratives of collapse informed by limited case studies. We argue for the development of a new interdisciplinary research effort to establish scientific understanding of settlement and settlement system persistence.

Anthromes have been suggested as one tool for integrating anthropogenic effects on ecosystems, but spatially explicit comparisons of biodiversity patterns are limited at a global extent. To address this gap, we used global data sets of anthromes and terrestrial vertebrate richness. We ranked anthromes by richness to all and threatened species at a global scale, temperate and tropical extents, and within major geographic regions. We tested for correlations between overall richness and count of threatened species, between taxonomic groups (birds, mammals, amphibians), and between taxa and conservation actions. At the global scale, there is high variation in vertebrate species richness by anthrome with low species richness in wildlands and higher richness in villages, rangelands, and woodlands. Threatened species distribution follows a similar pattern with high numbers of threatened species in village and remote seminatural woodland anthromes. Analyzes at temperate and tropical extents suggests unique opportunities in different regions, for example when considering the value of land sparing or sharing. There is clear heterogeneity across geographic regions. Richness in anthromes and hotspots are spatially aligned across all taxa but not for threatened taxa. Protection was negatively correlated with threatened bird richness. Human modified ecosystems provide opportunities for conservation and global and regional ranking of anthromes helps identify priorities that can complement biome and ecoregion-based prioritization. Currently, much of conservation research and prioritization is in wildlands or perceived natural landscapes, however this data shows a clear need to focus conservation efforts on seminatural, managed, and residential lands. These data would be helpful for global conservation organizations as an updated framework that can be used to prioritize global resource allocation while considering both ecological and social systems.","tags":null,"title":"Patterns of vertebrate richness across global anthromes: prioritizing conservation beyond biomes and ecoregions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Erle C.

Yet, a lingering paradigm among natural scientists, conservationists, and policymakers is that human transformation of terrestrial nature is mostly recent and inherently destructive. Here, we use the most up-to-date, spatially explicit global reconstruction of historical hu- man populations and land use to show that this paradigm is likely wrong. Even 12,000 y ago, nearly three quarters of Earth’s land was inhabited and therefore shaped by human societies, including more than 95% of temperate and 90% of tropical woodlands. Lands now characterized as “natural,” “intact,” and “wild” generally exhibit long histories of use, as do protected areas and Indigenous lands, and current global patterns of vertebrate species richness and key biodiversity areas are more strongly associated with past patterns of land use than with present ones in regional landscapes now characterized as natural. The current biodiversity crisis can seldom be explained by the loss of uninhabited wildlands, resulting instead from the appropriation, colonization, and intensifying use of the biodiverse cultural landscapes long shaped and sustained by prior societies. Recognizing this deep cultural connection with biodiversity will therefore be essential to resolve the crisis.","tags":null,"title":"People have shaped most of terrestrial nature for at least 12,000 years","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Nicolas Gauthier**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1611792000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611792000,"objectID":"45997d80b0a710aeedc810b4d1b0355e","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/publication/southwest-networks/","publishdate":"2021-01-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/southwest-networks/","section":"publication","summary":"In agricultural societies, farmers rely on their social networks to absorb the impacts of droughts and floods by facilitating resource flows to affected settlements and population flows away from them.

Although contemporary social scientists have studied climate-related migration and its outcomes intensively, little consensus has been reached to define the most significant social and environmental factors that promote or constrain migration and that may have been responsible for creating conditions of vulnerability in the societies confronted by climate change. This situation has been worsened by a failure to consider the historical contexts of migrations and the ways in which past decisions have affected modern outcomes. Our project, one of the three proposals initiated by the 2019 CfAS workshop on migration, proposes that comparative, synthetic archaeological research offers a powerful way to explore systematically the interaction of social and ecological factors within contexts of climate related migration and thus contribute a historical and social perspective useful to the contemporary world. Our project seeks to address both scientific and public policy goals to identify conditions that have influenced human decisions to migrate in response to changing climatic conditions and support local, Indigenous, and descendant communities in building effective strategies to adapt to current and future climate change. Framing our research using an archaeological implementation of the human security approach developed by the United Nations Development Programme, we will create a crowdsourced database of global scope to collect and synthesize archaeological examples of climate-related migration from 4000 BP to CE 1750. In this presentation, we outline the project and its key elements with a focus on how we will use the findings of this research to work with select Indigenous communities currently impacted by a rapidly warming world.","tags":null,"title":"Climate Migrants of the Past, Present, and Future","type":"talk"},{"authors":["**Nicolas Gauthier**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1596067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596067200,"objectID":"2bda829eb8e07fee34d2047ac382f7a6","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/publication/trade-migration/","publishdate":"2020-07-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/trade-migration/","section":"publication","summary":"Archaeological settlement patterns are the physical remains of complex webs of human decision-making and social interaction. Entropy-maximizing spatial interaction models are a means of building parsimonious models that average over much of this small-scale complexity, while maintaining key large-scale structural features. Dynamic social interaction models extend this approach by allowing archaeologists to explore the co-evolution of human settlement systems and the networks of interaction that drive them. Yet, such models are often imprecise, relying on generalized notions of settlement 'influence' and 'attractiveness' rather than concrete material flows of goods and people. Here, I present a dis-aggregated spatial interaction model that explicitly resolves trade and migration flows and their combined influence on settlement growth and decline. I explore how the balance of costs and benefits of each type of interaction influence long-term settlement patterns. I find trade flows are the strongest determinant of equilibrium settlement structure, and that migration flows play a more transient role in balancing site hierarchies.

Building upon recent efforts to standardize the format and terminology of paleoclimate data, this article describes the Paleoclimate Community reporTing Standard (PaCTS), a crowdsourced reporting standard for such data. PaCTS captures which information should be included when reporting paleoclimate data, with the goal of maximizing the reuse value of paleoclimate data sets, particularly for synthesis work and comparison to climate model simulations. Initiated by the LinkedEarth project, the process to elicit a reporting standard involved an international workshop in 2016, various forms of digital community engagement over the next few years, and grassroots working groups. Participants in this process identified important properties across paleoclimate archives, in addition to the reporting of uncertainties and chronologies; they also identified archive‐specific properties and distinguished reporting standards for new versus legacy data sets. This work shows that at least 135 respondents overwhelmingly support a drastic increase in the amount of metadata accompanying paleoclimate data sets. Since such goals are at odds with present practices, we discuss a transparent path toward implementing or revising these recommendations in the near future, using both bottom‐up and top‐down approaches.","tags":null,"title":"PaCTS 1.0: A Crowdsourced Reporting Standard for Paleoclimate Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucas Stephens","Dorian Fuller","Nicole Boivin","Torben Rick","**Nicolas Gauthier**","Andrea Kay","Ben Marwick","and the ArchaeoGLOBE project"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567123200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567123200,"objectID":"68d6eed1bfba166a2313f77df77b8cd0","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/publication/archaeoglobe/","publishdate":"2019-08-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/archaeoglobe/","section":"publication","summary":"Environmentally transformative human use of land accelerated with the emergence of agriculture, but the extent, trajectory, and implications of these early changes are not well understood.

Population growth increases both the number of mouths a society must feed and the number of people working to feed them. The balance between these two forces depends on the population's age structure. Although age structure ultimately reflects individual fertility and mortality, it is households that make decisions about the production and consumption of food, and their decisions depend on interactions with all other households in a settlement. How do these organizational levels interact to influence population growth and regulation? Here, I present a multi-level agent-based model of demography, food production, and social interaction in agricultural societies. I use the model to simulate the interactions of individuals, households, and settlements in a food-limited environment, and investigate the resulting patterns of population growth. Using Roman North Africa as a motivating example, I illustrate how abstract properties like 'carrying capacity' emerge from the concrete actions and interactions of millions of individual people.

To date, archaeologists have primarily relied on the dynamical approach because the idiosyncrasies of archaeological data make the wholesale adoption of statistical approaches from other fields impractical. Here, I argue for the use of generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) for statistical inference on interaction networks in archaeology. GAMMs are a flexible form of regression model well-matched to the complexities of the archaeological record, including non-normal distributions in the form of counts or proportions, non-independent observations with correlated errors, and non-linear functional relationships.

To better understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of climate change and human social-ecological-technological systems (or SETS) during the transition from full glacial to interglacial, we carried out a meta-analysis of archaeological and paleoenvironmental datasets across the western Mediterranean region. We compiled information on prehistoric technology, land-use, and hunting strategies from 291 archaeological assemblages, recovered from 122 sites extending from southern Spain, through Mediterranean France, to northern and peninsular Italy, as well as 2,386 radiocarbon dates from across this region. We combine these data on human ecological dynamics with paleoenvironmental information derived from global climate models, proxy data, and estimates of coastlines modeled from sea level estimates and digital terrain. The LGM represents an ecologically predictable period for over much of the western Mediterranean, while the remainder of the Pleistocene was increasingly unpredictable, making it a period of increased ecological risk for hunter-gatherers. In response to increasing spatial and temporal uncertainty, hunter-gatherers reorganized different constituents of their SETS, allowing regional populations to adapt to these conditions up to a point.

After reviewing the conceptual and computational principles underlying modern ESMs, I demonstrate how they can be readily coupled to ABMs that adhere to a few simple design rules, and illustrate the utility of this approach with a case study from Roman North Africa.","tags":null,"title":"Placing people in the environment: Coupling agent-based land-use and Earth system models","type":"talk"},{"authors":["**Nicolas Gauthier**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1480464000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1480464000,"objectID":"6f1eb72bdae33d5070453e6c643011bd","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/publication/farming-spread-aegean/","publishdate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/farming-spread-aegean/","section":"publication","summary":"I examine the relationship between the spatial pattern of aridification in the northeastern Mediterranean ca 8600 years ago and the spread of Neolithic farmers into the region surrounding the Aegean Sea. I use a generalized additive model to downscale winter rainfall from a state-of-the-art paleoclimate simulation. The model performs well at reproducing the present-day pattern of rainfall in the northeastern Mediterranean, and it generates physically-interpretable estimates of past rainfall consistent with global and regional proxy records of early Holocene climate. Comparing modeled rainfall with Neolithic settlement patterns reveals spatially-heterogeneous regional impacts of this period of global aridification. Only the humid regions of the Aegean coast experienced major drought, while more inland zones temporarily experienced more rainfall. The result of this spatially heterogeneous climate event was, conversely, more homogeneous regional rainfall. Neolithic colonists from southwest Asia would have encountered new landscapes with a more familiar, and predictable, precipitation regime.","tags":null,"title":"The spatial pattern of climate change during the spread of farming into the Aegean","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Nicolas Gauthier**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1369872000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1369872000,"objectID":"42677514acc3512e82e96906d7d7e836","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/publication/ba-thesis/","publishdate":"2013-05-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ba-thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"This study examines the development of agropastoralism in the Marmara Lake Basin in western Anatolia. It investigates how the interrelationships between geomorphology, hydrology, climate, and vegetation in and around the lake basin might have influenced the distribution of this form of land use across the landscape. It employs a combination of spatially explicit GIS-based environmental models and qualitative models of pastoral land use derived from the ethnographic, historical, and archaeological records. These landscape models serve to maximize the heuristic potential of limited archaeological datasets. The results of such research are not explicit reconstructions of prehistoric land-use systems, but rather a series of testable hypotheses to guide future research. These models suggest that climatic stability during the Early Holocene would have favored wetland agriculture and localized sheep herding, and that a shift to a highly variable climate during the Middle Holocene might have been met with increased dryland farming and extensive goat herding.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling agropastoral landscapes in the Marmara Lake Basin, western Anatolia","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"How have humans shaped Earth\u0026rsquo;s landscapes over millennia?
