Settlements (cities, towns, villages) are locations with two key attributes: They frame human interactions and activities in space, and they are where people dwell or live. Sustainability, in this case, focuses on the capacity of structures and functions of a settlement system (geography, demography, institutions) to provide for continuity of safe habitation. The 7,000-y-old experience of urbanism, as revealed by archaeology and history, includes many instances of settlements and settlement systems enduring, adapting to, or generating environmental, institutional, and technological changes. The field of urban sustainability lacks a firm scientific foundation for understanding the long durée, relying instead on narratives of collapse informed by limited case studies. We argue for the development of a new interdisciplinary research effort to establish scientific understanding of settlement and settlement system persistence. Such an effort would build upon the many fields that study human settlements to develop new theories and databases from the extensive documentation of ancient and premodern urban systems. A scientific foundation will generate novel insights to advance the field of urban sustainability.","tags":null,"title":"The persistence of ancient settlements and urban sustainability","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John E Quinn","Emma K Cook","**Nicolas Gauthier**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619593200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619593200,"objectID":"cf531263dad9340fc52e822218e0f0a4","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/publication/gecco/","publishdate":"2021-04-28T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/gecco/","section":"publication","summary":"There is a clear need to refocus the way we prioritize conservation actions at a global scale to incorporate human systems. Anthromes have been suggested as one tool for integrating anthropogenic effects on ecosystems, but spatially explicit comparisons of biodiversity patterns are limited at a global extent. To address this gap, we used global data sets of anthromes and terrestrial vertebrate richness. We ranked anthromes by richness to all and threatened species at a global scale, temperate and tropical extents, and within major geographic regions. We tested for correlations between overall richness and count of threatened species, between taxonomic groups (birds, mammals, amphibians), and between taxa and conservation actions. At the global scale, there is high variation in vertebrate species richness by anthrome with low species richness in wildlands and higher richness in villages, rangelands, and woodlands. Threatened species distribution follows a similar pattern with high numbers of threatened species in village and remote seminatural woodland anthromes. Analyzes at temperate and tropical extents suggests unique opportunities in different regions, for example when considering the value of land sparing or sharing. There is clear heterogeneity across geographic regions. Richness in anthromes and hotspots are spatially aligned across all taxa but not for threatened taxa. Protection was negatively correlated with threatened bird richness. Human modified ecosystems provide opportunities for conservation and global and regional ranking of anthromes helps identify priorities that can complement biome and ecoregion-based prioritization. Currently, much of conservation research and prioritization is in wildlands or perceived natural landscapes, however this data shows a clear need to focus conservation efforts on seminatural, managed, and residential lands. These data would be helpful for global conservation organizations as an updated framework that can be used to prioritize global resource allocation while considering both ecological and social systems.","tags":null,"title":"Patterns of vertebrate richness across global anthromes: prioritizing conservation beyond biomes and ecoregions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Erle C.

Yet, a lingering paradigm among natural scientists, conservationists, and policymakers is that human transformation of terrestrial nature is mostly recent and inherently destructive. Here, we use the most up-to-date, spatially explicit global reconstruction of historical hu- man populations and land use to show that this paradigm is likely wrong. Even 12,000 y ago, nearly three quarters of Earth’s land was inhabited and therefore shaped by human societies, including more than 95% of temperate and 90% of tropical woodlands. Lands now characterized as “natural,” “intact,” and “wild” generally exhibit long histories of use, as do protected areas and Indigenous lands, and current global patterns of vertebrate species richness and key biodiversity areas are more strongly associated with past patterns of land use than with present ones in regional landscapes now characterized as natural. The current biodiversity crisis can seldom be explained by the loss of uninhabited wildlands, resulting instead from the appropriation, colonization, and intensifying use of the biodiverse cultural landscapes long shaped and sustained by prior societies. Recognizing this deep cultural connection with biodiversity will therefore be essential to resolve the crisis.","tags":null,"title":"People have shaped most of terrestrial nature for at least 12,000 years","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Nicolas Gauthier**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1611817200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611817200,"objectID":"45997d80b0a710aeedc810b4d1b0355e","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/publication/southwest-networks/","publishdate":"2021-01-28T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/southwest-networks/","section":"publication","summary":"In agricultural societies, farmers rely on their social networks to absorb the impacts of droughts and floods by facilitating resource flows to affected settlements and population flows away from them.

Climate models are important tools for exploring historical and future snowpack dynamics, yet their relatively coarse spatial resolution can distort local topography and bias spatial patterns of accumulation and ablation. Here, we explore pattern-based statistical downscaling methods for application to simulations of spatially continuous interannual snowpack variability. Coupled pattern-based methods yield accurate, high resolution maps that correct mean and variance biases in domain-wide simulated snowpack. We find that a few leading patterns, present in both observations and reanalyses, capture the majority of snowpack variability across this domain. Methods that use large-scale patterns as both predictors and predictands perform better than those that do not, but we find that all are superior to a local interpolation-based approach. These findings suggest that pattern-based methods are appropriate for downscaling interannual snowpack variability, and that employing physically meaningful large-scale patterns is more important than the details of any particular downscaling method.","tags":null,"title":"Pattern-based downscaling of snowpack variability in the western United States","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1601535600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601535600,"objectID":"11d313b4dd3064c77db9f76ae2ddcd59","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/project/urban-persistence/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/urban-persistence/","section":"project","summary":"Assessing the demographic, institutional, and geographic determinants of persistent urban systems.","tags":["networks"],"title":"Urban Sustainability and the Persistence of Urban Systems","type":"project"},{"authors":["Mark Aldenderfer","Doug Bird","Kristina Douglass","**Nicolas Gauthier**","Scott Ingram","Beth Scaffidi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598511600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598511600,"objectID":"d67bad67c1f2c0f64e39b76e7482e8e3","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/talk/eaa-2020/","publishdate":"2020-08-27T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/eaa-2020/","section":"talk","summary":"The world’s Indigenous peoples are among those most dramatically affected by the increasingly rapid pace of global climate warming and many will become climate-related migrants, losing both their homelands and lifeways. Although contemporary social scientists have studied climate-related migration and its outcomes intensively, little consensus has been reached to define the most significant social and environmental factors that promote or constrain migration and that may have been responsible for creating conditions of vulnerability in the societies confronted by climate change. This situation has been worsened by a failure to consider the historical contexts of migrations and the ways in which past decisions have affected modern outcomes. Our project, one of the three proposals initiated by the 2019 CfAS workshop on migration, proposes that comparative, synthetic archaeological research offers a powerful way to explore systematically the interaction of social and ecological factors within contexts of climate related migration and thus contribute a historical and social perspective useful to the contemporary world. Our project seeks to address both scientific and public policy goals to identify conditions that have influenced human decisions to migrate in response to changing climatic conditions and support local, Indigenous, and descendant communities in building effective strategies to adapt to current and future climate change. Framing our research using an archaeological implementation of the human security approach developed by the United Nations Development Programme, we will create a crowdsourced database of global scope to collect and synthesize archaeological examples of climate-related migration from 4000 BP to CE 1750. In this presentation, we outline the project and its key elements with a focus on how we will use the findings of this research to work with select Indigenous communities currently impacted by a rapidly warming world.","tags":null,"title":"Climate Migrants of the Past, Present, and Future","type":"talk"},{"authors":["**Nicolas Gauthier**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1596092400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596092400,"objectID":"2bda829eb8e07fee34d2047ac382f7a6","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/publication/trade-migration/","publishdate":"2020-07-30T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/trade-migration/","section":"publication","summary":"Archaeological settlement patterns are the physical remains of complex webs of human decision-making and social interaction. Entropy-maximizing spatial interaction models are a means of building parsimonious models that average over much of this small-scale complexity, while maintaining key large-scale structural features. Dynamic social interaction models extend this approach by allowing archaeologists to explore the co-evolution of human settlement systems and the networks of interaction that drive them. Yet, such models are often imprecise, relying on generalized notions of settlement 'influence' and 'attractiveness' rather than concrete material flows of goods and people. Here, I present a dis-aggregated spatial interaction model that explicitly resolves trade and migration flows and their combined influence on settlement growth and decline. I explore how the balance of costs and benefits of each type of interaction influence long-term settlement patterns. I find trade flows are the strongest determinant of equilibrium settlement structure, and that migration flows play a more transient role in balancing site hierarchies. This model illustrates how the broad toolkit for spatial interaction modeling developed in geography and economics can increase the precision of quantitative theory building in archaeology, and provides a road-map for connecting mechanistic models to the empirical archaeological record.","tags":null,"title":"Trade, Migration, and the Dynamics of Spatial Interaction","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583046000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583046000,"objectID":"47d30f385b04ae7f0dd001e7aa6e62b8","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/project/downscaling/","publishdate":"2020-03-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/downscaling/","section":"project","summary":"Statistical downscaling of climate models for climate-change impact assessment.","tags":["downscaling"],"title":"Spatial Downscaling","type":"project"},{"authors":["**Nicolas Gauthier**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582614000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582614000,"objectID":"ce3ad87e3c82254f622fee11fa3a3fdb","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/publication/risk-perception/","publishdate":"2020-02-25T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/risk-perception/","section":"publication","summary":"Small-scale agriculturalists in the Mediterranean Basin rely on multiple strategies including diversification, intensification, and storage to maintain a stable food supply in the face of environmental uncertainty.

In this chapter, I present a simple agent-based model of a Mediterranean agroecosystem. By driving the model with realistic environmental dynamics derived from simulations of mid-Holocene Mediterranean climate, and by allowing the psychology of risk perception to vary among individual farmers, I explore the hidden vulnerabilities of traditional risk-management strategies to periods of rapid climate change.

This is especially true in the Big Data age, where analyzing large data volumes critically hinges on the data being standardized. Accordingly, the lack of community‐sanctioned data standards in paleoclimatology has largely precluded the benefits of Big Data advances in the field. Building upon recent efforts to standardize the format and terminology of paleoclimate data, this article describes the Paleoclimate Community reporTing Standard (PaCTS), a crowdsourced reporting standard for such data. PaCTS captures which information should be included when reporting paleoclimate data, with the goal of maximizing the reuse value of paleoclimate data sets, particularly for synthesis work and comparison to climate model simulations. Initiated by the LinkedEarth project, the process to elicit a reporting standard involved an international workshop in 2016, various forms of digital community engagement over the next few years, and grassroots working groups. Participants in this process identified important properties across paleoclimate archives, in addition to the reporting of uncertainties and chronologies; they also identified archive‐specific properties and distinguished reporting standards for new versus legacy data sets. This work shows that at least 135 respondents overwhelmingly support a drastic increase in the amount of metadata accompanying paleoclimate data sets. Since such goals are at odds with present practices, we discuss a transparent path toward implementing or revising these recommendations in the near future, using both bottom‐up and top‐down approaches.","tags":null,"title":"PaCTS 1.0: A Crowdsourced Reporting Standard for Paleoclimate Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567321200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567321200,"objectID":"2f5b1487f4bd98bec10a9a960771e2a1","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/project/archaeoglobe/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/archaeoglobe/","section":"project","summary":"Detecting global land-use trends in the archaeological record","tags":["land use"],"title":"ArchaeoGLOBE","type":"project"},{"authors":["Lucas Stephens","Dorian Fuller","Nicole Boivin","Torben Rick","**Nicolas Gauthier**","Andrea Kay","Ben Marwick","and the ArchaeoGLOBE project"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567148400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567148400,"objectID":"68d6eed1bfba166a2313f77df77b8cd0","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/publication/archaeoglobe/","publishdate":"2019-08-30T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/archaeoglobe/","section":"publication","summary":"Environmentally transformative human use of land accelerated with the emergence of agriculture, but the extent, trajectory, and implications of these early changes are not well understood.

Population growth increases both the number of mouths a society must feed and the number of people working to feed them. The balance between these two forces depends on the population's age structure. Although age structure ultimately reflects individual fertility and mortality, it is households that make decisions about the production and consumption of food, and their decisions depend on interactions with all other households in a settlement. How do these organizational levels interact to influence population growth and regulation? Here, I present a multi-level agent-based model of demography, food production, and social interaction in agricultural societies. I use the model to simulate the interactions of individuals, households, and settlements in a food-limited environment, and investigate the resulting patterns of population growth. Using Roman North Africa as a motivating example, I illustrate how abstract properties like 'carrying capacity' emerge from the concrete actions and interactions of millions of individual people.

To date, archaeologists have primarily relied on the dynamical approach because the idiosyncrasies of archaeological data make the wholesale adoption of statistical approaches from other fields impractical. Here, I argue for the use of generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) for statistical inference on interaction networks in archaeology. GAMMs are a flexible form of regression model well-matched to the complexities of the archaeological record, including non-normal distributions in the form of counts or proportions, non-independent observations with correlated errors, and non-linear functional relationships. Using two case studies -- an ethnographic marriage network and an archaeological assemblage similarity network -- I illustrate how this approach can lead to unbiased parameter estimates and more robust comparisons of competing hypotheses.

The concept of “frailty” has emerged as a convenient tool for relating observed skeletal lesions to human health and mortality, yet the biases inherent in archaeological samples have left the concept undertheorized. It remains unclear whether frailty should be considered an unchanging property of individuals -- an innate risk of death -- or whether frailty depends on changes in an individual’s external environment, such as a major epidemic event. Here, we analyze a sample of 193 individuals who died during the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, when healthy young adults (traditionally the least frail segment of the population) were most severely affected. We present data on age-at-death, and several nonspecific indicators of skeletal stress, and use a multi-state hazard model to show how the relationship between frailty and risk of death varied over the course of the pandemic. We discuss how a more rigorous approach to the concept of frailty in modern populations can improve our understanding of disease, mortality, and the determinants of health in the ancient world. These results suggest that frailty should not be considered in isolation from the physical and social environment.","tags":null,"title":"The frailty-mortality paradox: Insights from the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554102000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554102000,"objectID":"2bc44098c71e52be54a57be9b946d58a","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/project/gam-networks/","publishdate":"2019-04-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/gam-networks/","section":"project","summary":"Statistical modeling of complex spatial networks","tags":["networks","GAMs"],"title":"Generalized Additive Models for Spatial Networks","type":"project"},{"authors":["C Michael Barton","J Emili Aura Tortosa","Oreto Garcia-Puchol","Julien G Riel-Salvatore","**Nicolas Gauthier**","Margarita Vadillo Conesa","Geneviève Pothier Bouchard"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1521097200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1521097200,"objectID":"87c6c0b6215e9a9ae6cef550028e99e9","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/publication/risk-resilience/","publishdate":"2018-03-15T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/risk-resilience/","section":"publication","summary":"The period spanning the Last Glacial Maximum through early Holocene encompasses dramatic and rapid environmental changes that offered both increased risk and new opportunities to human populations of the Mediterranean zone. The regional effects of global climate change varied spatially with latitude, topography, and distance from a shifting coastline; and human adaptations to these changes played out at these regional scales. To better understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of climate change and human social-ecological-technological systems (or SETS) during the transition from full glacial to interglacial, we carried out a meta-analysis of archaeological and paleoenvironmental datasets across the western Mediterranean region. We compiled information on prehistoric technology, land-use, and hunting strategies from 291 archaeological assemblages, recovered from 122 sites extending from southern Spain, through Mediterranean France, to northern and peninsular Italy, as well as 2,386 radiocarbon dates from across this region. We combine these data on human ecological dynamics with paleoenvironmental information derived from global climate models, proxy data, and estimates of coastlines modeled from sea level estimates and digital terrain. The LGM represents an ecologically predictable period for over much of the western Mediterranean, while the remainder of the Pleistocene was increasingly unpredictable, making it a period of increased ecological risk for hunter-gatherers. In response to increasing spatial and temporal uncertainty, hunter-gatherers reorganized different constituents of their SETS, allowing regional populations to adapt to these conditions up to a point. Beyond this threshold, rapid environmental change resulted in significant demographic change in Mediterranean hunter-gatherer populations.","tags":null,"title":"Risk and resilience in the late glacial: A case study from the western Mediterranean","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1506841200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506841200,"objectID":"dc48991df694deb9f328bb42074f8d57","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/project/agricultural-spread/","publishdate":"2017-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/agricultural-spread/","section":"project","summary":"Modeling the causes and consequences of the origins and spread of agriculture in the Mediterranean.","tags":["land-use","agent-based-model"],"title":"Origins and Spread of Agriculture","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1491116400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491116400,"objectID":"789820ed30d24bf31dd9a425726fde7b","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/talk/saa-2018/","publishdate":"2017-04-02T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/saa-2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Earth system models are climate models capable of simulating land-atmosphere feedbacks and the complex biogeochemical and biogeophysical processes that drive them.

Social networks can absorb climate shocks by facilitating resource flows to afflicted nodes and population flows away from them. Because this property of social networks depends on their ability to connect regions with anti-correlated rainfall, we expect the interaction between landscape connectivity and drought spatio-temporal covariance structures will select for particular network configurations. To test this hypothesis, we compare diachronic social-network proxies from the U.S. Southwest to an ensemble of paleoclimate model simulations. We first use outputs from the Community Earth System Model Last Millennium Ensemble project to calculate a multiscalar drought index for the period AD 1150-1450. We then use Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis to decompose these complex space-time fields into maps of the leading modes of drought variability. Finally, we compare these maps to network data produced by the Southwest Social Networks project, testing whether ties between nodes in opposing climate dipoles are stronger than would be expected by chance alone. Mobilising these two spatially explicit and diachronic archaeological and climatological datasets allows us to quantitatively assess the complex interplay between social and ecological dynamics on large regional scales.","tags":null,"title":"Drought Variability and the Robustness of Agrarian Social Networks","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1491116400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491116400,"objectID":"b8b0f424481cd4d37288a423e5b4ac79","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/talk/caa-2017/","publishdate":"2017-04-02T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/caa-2017/","section":"talk","summary":"I present a simple mathematical model of a network of human settlements and natural ecosystems from urban studies, and assess the impact of parametric uncertainty on our understanding of the dynamics of archaeological networks.

I show how processes that would otherwise require ad-hoc submodules in a standalone ABM (e.g. precipitation, crop yield, and soil fertility) can instead be directly simulated using physically consistent and previously validated representations in an ESM. After reviewing the conceptual and computational principles underlying modern ESMs, I demonstrate how they can be readily coupled to ABMs that adhere to a few simple design rules, and illustrate the utility of this approach with a case study from Roman North Africa.","tags":null,"title":"Placing people in the environment: Coupling agent-based land-use and Earth system models","type":"talk"},{"authors":["**Nicolas Gauthier**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1480489200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1480489200,"objectID":"6f1eb72bdae33d5070453e6c643011bd","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/publication/farming-spread-aegean/","publishdate":"2016-11-30T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/farming-spread-aegean/","section":"publication","summary":"I examine the relationship between the spatial pattern of aridification in the northeastern Mediterranean ca 8600 years ago and the spread of Neolithic farmers into the region surrounding the Aegean Sea. I use a generalized additive model to downscale winter rainfall from a state-of-the-art paleoclimate simulation. The model performs well at reproducing the present-day pattern of rainfall in the northeastern Mediterranean, and it generates physically-interpretable estimates of past rainfall consistent with global and regional proxy records of early Holocene climate. Comparing modeled rainfall with Neolithic settlement patterns reveals spatially-heterogeneous regional impacts of this period of global aridification. Only the humid regions of the Aegean coast experienced major drought, while more inland zones temporarily experienced more rainfall. The result of this spatially heterogeneous climate event was, conversely, more homogeneous regional rainfall. Neolithic colonists from southwest Asia would have encountered new landscapes with a more familiar, and predictable, precipitation regime.","tags":null,"title":"The spatial pattern of climate change during the spread of farming into the Aegean","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461740400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461740400,"objectID":"ceb546f69f931a46f2419724b1657d4c","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/project/medland/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/medland/","section":"project","summary":"Proxy system modeling for the Mediterranean Landcape Dynamics project","tags":["land-use","agent-based-model"],"title":"Mediterranean Landscape Dynamics","type":"project"}]
