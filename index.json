Population growth increases both the number of mouths a society must feed and the number of people working to feed them. The balance between these two forces depends on the population's age structure. Although age structure ultimately reflects individual fertility and mortality, it is households that make decisions about the production and consumption of food, and their decisions depend on interactions with all other households in a settlement. How do these organizational levels interact to influence population growth and regulation? Here, I present a multi-level agent-based model of demography, food production, and social interaction in agricultural societies. I use the model to simulate the interactions of individuals, households, and settlements in a food-limited environment, and investigate the resulting patterns of population growth. Using Roman North Africa as a motivating example, I illustrate how abstract properties like 'carrying capacity' emerge from the concrete actions and interactions of millions of individual people. Looking forward, bottom-up simulations rooted in first principles of human behavior will be crucial for understanding the coevolution of preindustrial societies and their natural environments.","tags":null,"title":"Multilevel simulation of demography and food production in ancient agrarian societies: A case study from Roman North Africa","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Nicolas Gauthier**"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1557903600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557903600,"objectID":"45997d80b0a710aeedc810b4d1b0355e","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/publication/southwest-networks/","publishdate":"2019-05-15T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/southwest-networks/","section":"publication","summary":"In agricultural societies, farmers rely on their social networks to absorb the impacts of droughts and floods by facilitating resource flows to affected settlements and population flows away from them. These benefits depend on how well one's social network connects populations that experience different weather patterns. Here I use an empirical archaeological case study from the late pre-Hispanic period in the North American Southwest to examine the relationship between drought variability and human social networks over a 250 year period. I analyze 7.5 million artifacts collected from nearly 500 archaeological sites, and estimate how the flow of social information between sites varied as a function of distance and growing-season hydroclimate variability. Interaction between regions experiencing different oceanic and continental influences was often higher than would be expected by chance and distance alone, but the intensity of this influence changed over time. This work highlights the importance of distinguishing between different dynamic origins of hydroclimate variability when considering the social impacts of droughts and pluvials in the past and present.","tags":null,"title":"Hydroclimate variability influenced social interaction in the prehistoric American Southwest","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1555052400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555052400,"objectID":"8f22d771e75b83d45fc08b634d5edfec","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/talk/saa-2019b/","publishdate":"2019-04-12T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/saa-2019b/","section":"talk","summary":"Distance is a fundamental constraint on human social interaction. This basic principle motivates the use of spatial interaction models for estimating flows of people, information, and resources on spatial and social networks. These models have both valid dynamical and statistical interpretations, a key strength well supported by theory and data from geography, economics, ecology, and genetics. To date, archaeologists have primarily relied on the dynamical approach because the idiosyncrasies of archaeological data make the wholesale adoption of statistical approaches from other fields impractical. Here, I argue for the use of generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) for statistical inference on interaction networks in archaeology. GAMMs are a flexible form of regression model well-matched to the complexities of the archaeological record, including non-normal distributions in the form of counts or proportions, non-independent observations with correlated errors, and non-linear functional relationships. Using two case studies -- an ethnographic marriage network and an archaeological assemblage similarity network -- I illustrate how this approach can lead to unbiased parameter estimates and more robust comparisons of competing hypotheses. I conclude by outlining how future empirical efforts can help to refine our thinking about past network dynamics and reveal cross-cultural regularities of human social interaction in the present day.","tags":null,"title":"Generalized Additive Mixed Models for Spatial Networks","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554966000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554966000,"objectID":"1c04f1e5b6ff189a22080e661909c036","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/talk/saa-2019a/","publishdate":"2019-04-11T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/saa-2019a/","section":"talk","summary":"The difficulty of inferring health from skeletal remains is an enduring problem in bioarchaeology. The concept of “frailty” has emerged as a convenient tool for relating observed skeletal lesions to human health and mortality, yet the biases inherent in archaeological samples have left the concept undertheorized. It remains unclear whether frailty should be considered an unchanging property of individuals -- an innate risk of death -- or whether frailty depends on changes in an individual’s external environment, such as a major epidemic event. Here, we analyze a sample of 193 individuals who died during the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, when healthy young adults (traditionally the least frail segment of the population) were most severely affected. We present data on age-at-death, and several nonspecific indicators of skeletal stress, and use a multi-state hazard model to show how the relationship between frailty and risk of death varied over the course of the pandemic. We discuss how a more rigorous approach to the concept of frailty in modern populations can improve our understanding of disease, mortality, and the determinants of health in the ancient world. These results suggest that frailty should not be considered in isolation from the physical and social environment.","tags":null,"title":"The frailty-mortality paradox: Insights from the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554102000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554102000,"objectID":"2bc44098c71e52be54a57be9b946d58a","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/project/gam-networks/","publishdate":"2019-04-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/gam-networks/","section":"project","summary":"Statistical modeling of complex spatial networks","tags":["networks","GAMs"],"title":"Generalized Additive Models for Spatial Networks","type":"project"},{"authors":["C Michael Barton","J Emili Aura Tortosa","Oreto Garcia-Puchol","Julien G Riel-Salvatore","**Nicolas Gauthier**","Margarita Vadillo Conesa","Geneviève Pothier Bouchard"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1521097200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1521097200,"objectID":"87c6c0b6215e9a9ae6cef550028e99e9","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/publication/risk-resilience/","publishdate":"2018-03-15T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/risk-resilience/","section":"publication","summary":"The period spanning the Last Glacial Maximum through early Holocene encompasses dramatic and rapid environmental changes that offered both increased risk and new opportunities to human populations of the Mediterranean zone. The regional effects of global climate change varied spatially with latitude, topography, and distance from a shifting coastline; and human adaptations to these changes played out at these regional scales. To better understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of climate change and human social-ecological-technological systems (or SETS) during the transition from full glacial to interglacial, we carried out a meta-analysis of archaeological and paleoenvironmental datasets across the western Mediterranean region. We compiled information on prehistoric technology, land-use, and hunting strategies from 291 archaeological assemblages, recovered from 122 sites extending from southern Spain, through Mediterranean France, to northern and peninsular Italy, as well as 2,386 radiocarbon dates from across this region. We combine these data on human ecological dynamics with paleoenvironmental information derived from global climate models, proxy data, and estimates of coastlines modeled from sea level estimates and digital terrain. The LGM represents an ecologically predictable period for over much of the western Mediterranean, while the remainder of the Pleistocene was increasingly unpredictable, making it a period of increased ecological risk for hunter-gatherers. In response to increasing spatial and temporal uncertainty, hunter-gatherers reorganized different constituents of their SETS, allowing regional populations to adapt to these conditions up to a point. Beyond this threshold, rapid environmental change resulted in significant demographic change in Mediterranean hunter-gatherer populations.","tags":null,"title":"Risk and resilience in the late glacial: A case study from the western Mediterranean","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1491116400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491116400,"objectID":"789820ed30d24bf31dd9a425726fde7b","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/talk/saa-2018/","publishdate":"2017-04-02T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/saa-2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Earth system models are climate models capable of simulating land-atmosphere feedbacks and the complex biogeochemical and biogeophysical processes that drive them.

Social networks can absorb climate shocks by facilitating resource flows to afflicted nodes and population flows away from them. Because this property of social networks depends on their ability to connect regions with anti-correlated rainfall, we expect the interaction between landscape connectivity and drought spatio-temporal covariance structures will select for particular network configurations. To test this hypothesis, we compare diachronic social-network proxies from the U.S. Southwest to an ensemble of paleoclimate model simulations. We first use outputs from the Community Earth System Model Last Millennium Ensemble project to calculate a multiscalar drought index for the period AD 1150-1450. We then use Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis to decompose these complex space-time fields into maps of the leading modes of drought variability. Finally, we compare these maps to network data produced by the Southwest Social Networks project, testing whether ties between nodes in opposing climate dipoles are stronger than would be expected by chance alone. Mobilising these two spatially explicit and diachronic archaeological and climatological datasets allows us to quantitatively assess the complex interplay between social and ecological dynamics on large regional scales.","tags":null,"title":"Drought Variability and the Robustness of Agrarian Social Networks","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1491116400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491116400,"objectID":"b8b0f424481cd4d37288a423e5b4ac79","permalink":"https://nick-gauthier.github.io/talk/caa-2017/","publishdate":"2017-04-02T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/caa-2017/","section":"talk","summary":"I present a simple mathematical model of a network of human settlements and natural ecosystems from urban studies, and assess the impact of parametric uncertainty on our understanding of the dynamics of archaeological networks.

The model performs well at reproducing the present-day pattern of rainfall in the northeastern Mediterranean, and it generates physically-interpretable estimates of past rainfall consistent with global and regional proxy records of early Holocene climate. Comparing modeled rainfall with Neolithic settlement patterns reveals spatially-heterogeneous regional impacts of this period of global aridification.
