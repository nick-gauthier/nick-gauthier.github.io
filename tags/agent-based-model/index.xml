      <title>Simulating Social-Ecological Cascades</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What made the Black Death so devastating, and what can it teach us about pandemics today? Our team is combining cutting-edge computer modeling with evidence from medieval skeletal remains, tree rings, and historical records to reconstruct one of history&amp;rsquo;s deadliest pandemics. By analyzing how climate changes affected crops, migration patterns, and urban life, we&amp;rsquo;re uncovering how environmental and social factors combined to create perfect conditions for catastrophic disease outbreaks. This innovative approach doesn&amp;rsquo;t just illuminate history â€“ it&amp;rsquo;s helping us understand how climate and society influence modern disease outbreaks, offering crucial insights for public health planning in our changing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was recently funded by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2409068&amp;amp;HistoricalAwards=false&#34;&gt;US National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Digital Prehistory: Simulating Ancient Human-Environment Systems</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How did ancient societies grow, move, and adapt to environmental change? Our team is developing powerful new computational tools to simulate the fundamental patterns of human civilization - from population growth and migration to agriculture and trade. At the heart of this work is MALTHUS, an open-source modeling framework that recreates how preindustrial societies responded to changes in food availability, climate, and landscape. By running thousands of virtual societies on high-performance computers, we can test theories about how environmental constraints shaped human history and better understand humanity&amp;rsquo;s long-term relationship with Earth&amp;rsquo;s systems. This work provides a computational laboratory for exploring age-old questions about population, resources, and societal development, while offering new insights for modeling human behavior in modern Earth system science.&lt;/p&gt;
