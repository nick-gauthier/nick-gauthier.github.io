      <title>Evolution in the Ancient Mediterranean: Plants and People Through Time</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean Basin harbors an extraordinary diversity of plant life, including over 350 species of bellflowers - half of which are found nowhere else on Earth. But how has thousands of years of human activity shaped this unique botanical heritage? Working with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/cellinese-lab/&#34;&gt;Dr. Nico Cellinese&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues at the Florida Museum of Natural History, we&amp;rsquo;re combining cutting-edge genetic analysis with archaeological data on past human land use to reconstruct the evolutionary journey of these remarkable plants. By tracking how ancient farming, grazing, and urbanization influenced where bellflowers could grow and survive, we&amp;rsquo;re uncovering how human civilization has become intertwined with plant evolution. This work not only illuminates the deep history of human-environment relationships in the Mediterranean but also helps predict how these unique species might respond to future environmental change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was recently funded by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2348709&amp;amp;HistoricalAwards=false&#34;&gt;US National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Digital Prehistory: Simulating Ancient Human-Environment Systems</title>
      <link>https://nick-gauthier.github.io/project/demography/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How did ancient societies grow, move, and adapt to environmental change? Our team is developing powerful new computational tools to simulate the fundamental patterns of human civilization - from population growth and migration to agriculture and trade. At the heart of this work is MALTHUS, an open-source modeling framework that recreates how preindustrial societies responded to changes in food availability, climate, and landscape. By running thousands of virtual societies on high-performance computers, we can test theories about how environmental constraints shaped human history and better understand humanity&amp;rsquo;s long-term relationship with Earth&amp;rsquo;s systems. This work provides a computational laboratory for exploring age-old questions about population, resources, and societal development, while offering new insights for modeling human behavior in modern Earth system science.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Cities Survive: Measuring Urban Persistence Through Time</title>
      <link>https://nick-gauthier.github.io/project/urban-persistence/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What determines whether a city survives for decades or millennia? Working with Arizona State University&amp;rsquo;s School of Human Evolution and Social Change, our team is building one of archaeology&amp;rsquo;s most detailed databases of urban settlements. By combining intensive archaeological survey data with historical records, we&amp;rsquo;re tracking how cities responded to challenges across time and space. This unprecedented detail allows us to untangle the complex relationships between geographic advantages, population dynamics, and institutional structures that helped some settlements persist while others vanished. Our findings offer new perspectives on urban resilience, revealing patterns that connect ancient urban experiences to modern questions of city survival and adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
