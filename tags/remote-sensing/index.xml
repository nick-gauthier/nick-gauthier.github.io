      <description>&lt;p&gt;Off the coast of Florida lie hidden traces of remarkable environmental engineering â€“ artificial islands and coastal structures built by indigenous peoples centuries ago. Using cutting-edge LiDAR technology, our team is mapping these submerged and eroded landscapes to understand how past societies shaped their coastal environments. By combining aerial scanning with advanced modeling, we&amp;rsquo;re uncovering how these engineered landscapes supported complex civilizations and continue to influence coastal dynamics today. This research not only illuminates a fascinating chapter of human ingenuity but also provides crucial insights for modern coastal management and climate adaptation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
